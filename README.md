Hand Gesture Recognition plays a key role in human-computer interactions. As we can see that there are so many new Technological advancements happening such as biometric authentication which we can see frequently in our smart phones, similarly hand gesture recognition is a modern way of human-computer interaction i.e., we can control our system by showing our hands in front of webcam and hand gesture recognition is done . Based upon this idea this project is presented. This project provides a detailed explanation to the algorithms and methodologies for the color detection and virtual mouse. Existing system isa Computer Mouse is an input device that helps to point and to interact with whatever that is being pointed. There are so many types of mouse in the current trend, thereâ€™s the mechanical mouse that consists of a single rubber ball which can rotate in any direction and the movement of the pointer is determined by the motion of that rubber ball. Proposed system is the technology increase everything becomes virtualized such as speech recognition. Speech Recognition is used for recognition and translation of the spoken language into text. Computer vision techniques are used for gesture recognition. OpenCV consists of a package called video capture which is used to capture data from a live video. Main thing we need to identify are the applications the model is going to develop so the development of the mouse movement without using the system mouse.
